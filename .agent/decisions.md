# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Node.js 24 LTS Runtime

- **Date**: 2026-10-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The frontend application requires a stable Node.js runtime aligned with modern ECMAScript standards, performance optimizations, and long-term security maintenance, matching the backend runtime.
- **Options**:
  1. Node.js 20 LTS
  2. Node.js 22 LTS
  3. Node.js 24 LTS
- **Choice**: Node.js 24 LTS with `.nvmrc` set to `24` and `package.json` engines pinned to `>=24 <25`.
- **Reasons**: Node 24 is the active LTS release offering updated V8 engine optimizations, standard native cryptographic and fetch primitives, and parity with the `techeniac-lms-backend` environment.
- **Consequences**: Local development and deployment environments must use Node 24. Older Node runtime environments are unsupported.

## ADR-002: Next.js 16 App Router Framework

- **Date**: 2026-10-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The frontend requires a production React framework supporting server-side rendering, streaming, static optimization, edge routing, and native TypeScript support.
- **Options**:
  1. Vite + React Single Page App (SPA)
  2. Next.js 14 / 15 Pages Router
  3. Next.js 16 App Router with Turbopack
- **Choice**: Next.js 16.4.0 with App Router, Turbopack, and React 19.
- **Reasons**: Next.js 16 is the verified stable release installed by `create-next-app@latest`. App Router provides first-class React Server Components, streaming SSR, built-in metadata management, and nested layouts, while Turbopack dramatically accelerates local build and development cycles.
- **Consequences**: Route definitions must follow App Router folder conventions (`app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`). Client interactivity requires explicit `'use client'` directives.

---

## ADR-003: TypeScript Compiler Strictness Flags

- **Date**: 2026-10-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: We need to configure TypeScript compilation options to guarantee maximum static type safety without breaking framework runtime execution or build pipelines.
- **Options**:
  1. Standard `strict: true` baseline only.
  2. `strict: true` with selective flags (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`) while disabling `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` based on hypothetical third-party typing conflicts.
  3. Fully enabled strict compiler flags: `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, `noImplicitOverride: true`, and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`.
- **Choice**: Option 3 (All four strict flags enabled).
- **Reasons**:
  - We ran empirical evaluations testing `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` on the scaffolded Next.js 16 App Router project with all four flags enabled.
  - The static analysis and Turbopack production build both exited with code 0 without any type or compilation errors.
  - Rather than disabling `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` based on assumptions, empirical evidence demonstrates full compatibility with the Next.js 16 and React 19 foundation.
  - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` prevents invisible undefined runtime indexing errors.
  - `noImplicitOverride: true` enforces explicit intent when extending classes or methods.
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` prevents accidentally assigning `undefined` to optional properties that expect omission or explicit values.
- **Consequences**: Developers must write precise types, handle potential `undefined` array lookups, and respect exact optional property assignments.

## ADR-004: Decoupled Repositories vs Monorepo

- **Date**: 2026-10-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The Techeniac LMS consists of an API backend (`techeniac-lms-backend`) and a user-facing frontend (`techeniac-lms-frontend`). We must select repository architecture.
- **Options**:
  1. Unified Monorepo housing both backend and frontend.
  2. Decoupled individual repositories (`techeniac-lms-backend` and `techeniac-lms-frontend`).
- **Choice**: Decoupled individual repositories.
- **Reasons**:
  - Autonomous deployment lifecycles and CI/CD pipelines (Vercel/edge for frontend, container/cloud for backend).
  - Clear domain boundaries: the backend exposes a versioned REST API (`/api/v1`), and the frontend acts as an API consumer.
  - Simpler dependency trees without monorepo tooling overhead (e.g. Turborepo, Nx).
  - Independent security access and repository permissions.
- **Consequences**: API contracts must be formally synchronized via OpenAPI specifications.

## ADR-005: Pull Request Merging & Linear History Discipline

- **Date**: 2026-10-14 (Updated: 2026-10-19)
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: A Git branching and merging strategy is required to maintain a readable, bisectable history across integration branches.
- **Options**:
  1. Merge commits via Pull Requests (`git merge --no-ff`)
  2. Fast-forward rebase
  3. Squash merge via Pull Requests
- **Choice**: Merge commits via reviewed Pull Requests with Conventional Commits for all branches merged into `dev`, with structured promotion across `dev` -> `staging` -> `main`.
- **Reasons**:
  - Preserves complete development commit history and author attribution across pull requests.
  - Produces traceable PR merge points linking features and fixes to their PR context.
  - Maintains strict semantic versioning and changelog accuracy through Conventional Commits.
- **Consequences**: Individual commit histories on feature branches are preserved upon merge. Developers must write Conventional Commit messages for all commits on working branches.

---

## ADR-006: Folder Layout & Component Tiering

- **Date**: 2026-10-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: As the LMS application scales to include public landing pages, student portals, instructor course builders, and admin panels, clear folder conventions are necessary to prevent architectural decay.
- **Options**:
  1. Flat component structure inside `components/` and arbitrary route nesting.
  2. Feature-sliced route groups with a four-tier component architecture (`components/{ui,patterns,layout,app}`) and dedicated directories for `hooks/`, `services/`, `lib/`, and `context/`.
- **Choice**: Option 2.
- **Reasons**:
  - Route groups `app/(public)` and `app/(auth)` provide clear layout boundaries and route separation without altering URL pathnames.
  - Primitive UI atoms (`components/ui`) remain decoupled from business logic.
  - Complex UI assemblies (`components/patterns`) provide reusable compositions.
  - Page-specific views (`components/app`) keep route files lightweight.
  - Server state is isolated in TanStack Query via `services/`, preventing client context bloat.
- **Consequences**: Developers must place components and files within their appropriate tier based on reusability and scope.

---

## ADR-007: Migration to Proxy Convention (`proxy.ts`)

- **Date**: 2026-10-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: In Next.js 16, the `middleware.ts` convention is officially deprecated in favor of `proxy.ts` (documented in `docs/01-app/03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/proxy.md`). Turbopack outputs deprecation warnings during build when `middleware.ts` is present.
- **Options**:
  1. Retain deprecated `middleware.ts` and ignore build deprecation warnings.
  2. Migrate to the native Next.js 16 `proxy.ts` convention with `export function proxy()` and standard config matcher.
- **Choice**: Option 2 (`proxy.ts`).
- **Reasons**:
  - Next.js renamed the convention to prevent confusion with Express.js middleware and clarify that the feature acts as a network/edge boundary in front of the application.
  - Adopting `proxy.ts` eliminates deprecation warnings during `npm run build` and ensures long-term alignment with Next.js 16+ API conventions.
  - The routing logic (`NextResponse.next()`) and critical security disclaimer are preserved without behavioral regressions.
- **Consequences**: Root routing logic is maintained in `proxy.ts`. Developers must export `proxy` instead of `middleware`.

## ADR-008: Development Quality Tools, Architecture Confinement, and Hook Pipeline

- **Date**: 2026-10-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The frontend codebase requires strict automated quality gates to prevent code quality decay, architectural boundary erosion, secret leaks, and non-conventional git commit histories as the application scales.
- **Options**:
  1. Rely on default Next.js ESLint and manual code reviews.
  2. Implement an automated multi-tier quality pipeline: ESLint 9 Flat Config with type-aware linting (`tsconfig.eslint.json`), custom architecture confinement rules, automated lint fixture verification, Husky 9 Git hooks with Gitleaks secret detection, Commitlint conventional commit enforcement, and Prettier with Tailwind CSS class sorting.
- **Choice**: Option 2.
- **Reasons**:
  - Type-aware TypeScript ESLint rules enforce strict standards (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`, `no-console`, `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`, `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises`, `simple-import-sort`, `jsx-a11y/alt-text`) without polluting production `tsconfig.json`.
  - Architecture confinement rules (`architecture/ui-primitive-confinement`, `architecture/service-calls-only-in-hooks`) prevent UI primitives (`components/ui/**`) from importing higher tiers or business logic, and restrict direct service calls (`services/**`) to React hooks (`hooks/**`).
  - An automated test harness (`scripts/test-lint-rules.mjs` and `lint-fixtures/`) proves deterministically that all architecture and critical quality rules trigger expected errors.
  - Husky Git hooks (`pre-commit`, `commit-msg`) execute Gitleaks secret detection, `lint-staged` autofix and formatting, TypeScript compilation checks, and Conventional Commit validation prior to recording changes.
  - Prettier with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` enforces consistent formatting and deterministic Tailwind CSS class ordering.
  - Next.js `proxy.ts` is maintained and explicitly documented as a routing and UX mechanism rather than a security boundary; backend authorization remains authoritative.
- **Consequences**:
  - All commits must pass typecheck, lint, formatting, secret scanning, and commit-msg validation.
  - Developers must have Gitleaks installed locally to commit changes.
  - Architecture boundaries are enforced automatically during linting and in supported IDEs.

## ADR-009: Centralized Reusable Validation Primitives with Zod

- **Date**: 2026-10-15
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: User input across frontend forms (e.g., authentication, password reset, account management, profile editing) requires client-side validation to provide immediate feedback. Implementing ad-hoc schemas across different components leads to duplicated logic, inconsistent error messaging, and drift from backend validation rules.
- **Options**:
  1. Define independent inline Zod schemas within individual form components.
  2. Rely solely on HTML5 input attributes and backend validation responses.
  3. Establish centralized, reusable atomic validation schemas in `lib/validation/` using Zod.
- **Choice**: Option 3 (Centralized atomic schemas in `lib/validation/`).
- **Reasons**:
  - Parity with backend constraints: Enforces exact parity with `techeniac-lms-backend` validation rules (`passwordSchema`, `emailSchema`, `uuidSchema`), guaranteeing identical password complexity (min 10, max 64, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character) and email formats.
  - DRY & Composable: Individual form schemas (login, registration, change password) compose these centralized primitives directly rather than duplicating validation rules.
  - Type Inference: Zod provides automatic TypeScript type inference (`z.infer<typeof schema>`), ensuring end-to-end type safety between form state and validated data.
- **Consequences**:
  - All reusable validation primitives reside in `lib/validation/common.schemas.ts` and are re-exported via `lib/validation/index.ts`.
  - Component forms import shared primitives from `@/lib/validation` when constructing composite form schemas.

## ADR-010: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline for Universal Pull Requests

- **Date**: 2026-10-15
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: To guarantee repository integrity, prevent broken builds, and protect against secret leaks before merging code, continuous integration must run on all pull requests and main pushes.
- **Options**:
  1. Trigger CI solely on pull requests targeting `main`.
  2. Rely only on local pre-commit hooks without automated remote CI verification.
  3. Universal pull request workflow triggering on any pull request between any branches plus pushes to `main`.
- **Choice**: Option 3 (Universal pull request trigger with fail-fast stages).
- **Reasons**:
  - Covers all PR branches: Developers frequently open PRs into feature branches or release branches before merging to `main`; running checks on all PRs guarantees defects are caught early regardless of branching path.
  - Fail-fast quality gates: The job executes secret scanning (Gitleaks), deterministic installation (`npm ci`), static typing (`tsc --noEmit`), linting (`eslint --max-warnings=0`), architecture boundary verification (`npm run lint:test-rules`), formatting check (`prettier --check`), and Turbopack production build (`next build`).
  - Next.js build cache: Leverages GitHub Actions caching for `.next/cache` to keep CI run times under 2 minutes.
  - Concurrency management: Automatically cancels stale in-flight runs when new commits are pushed to the same PR.
- **Consequences**:
  - All pull requests require a green CI status check to pass quality review.
  - CI workflow is maintained at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## ADR-011: Branching Hierarchy & Protected Branches Strategy

- **Date**: 2026-10-15
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: As development scales across multiple contributors, a disciplined branching strategy is necessary to prevent untested code or direct commits from polluting integration (`dev`), staging (`staging`), and production (`main`) branches.
- **Options**:
  1. Trunk-based development allowing direct commits to `main` by core maintainers.
  2. Single default branch (`main`) with feature branches.
  3. Tiered Gitflow-inspired hierarchy ($\text{main} \leftarrow \text{staging} \leftarrow \text{dev} \leftarrow \text{feat/*}$) with protected branches enforced locally and remotely.
- **Choice**: Option 3 (Tiered branch hierarchy with protected branches).
- **Reasons**:
  - Clear separation of concerns: `main` tracks production releases, `staging` tracks pre-production/QA verification, and `dev` serves as the shared integration target.
  - Multi-tier enforcement: Direct commits to `main`, `staging`, and `dev` are prevented locally via the `.husky/pre-commit` hook and remotely via GitHub branch protection rules.
  - Unified CI: The GitHub Actions CI pipeline runs on every Pull Request between any branches and validates post-merge builds across `main`, `staging`, and `dev`.
- **Consequences**:
  - Developers must work in feature/fix branches (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`) created off `dev`.
  - Direct commits on `main`, `staging`, or `dev` trigger immediate failure in `.husky/pre-commit`.
  - Merging into protected branches requires Pull Requests and passing CI checks.

## ADR-012: Domain Statuses Modeled as String Enums & Boundary Normalization

- **Date**: 2026-10-28
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Domain status types across courses and submissions (e.g. `AssignmentScope`, `SubmissionMode`, `SubmissionStatus`, `AssignmentDerivedStatus`) had inconsistent modeling between string unions and TypeScript enums. Furthermore, submission payloads from backend APIs could contain dual camelCase/snake_case keys (`pdfUrl`/`pdf_url`, `zipUrl`/`zip_url`, `linkUrl`/`url`), causing unsafe `as` casts across consuming components.
- **Options**:
  1. Plain string union aliases throughout the frontend without runtime enum objects.
  2. Ad-hoc dual-key checks and `as string` casts scattered across individual React components.
  3. Standardize domain statuses as TypeScript string enums matching backend entities, and normalize API response/request data at the service boundary (`services/submissions.service.ts`).
- **Choice**: Option 3 (String enums + service boundary normalization).
- **Reasons**:
  - Consistency: Establishes a uniform convention across all LMS domain statuses matching `types/courses.ts` (`AssignmentScope`, `SubmissionMode`) and backend entities (`SubmissionStatus`).
  - Type safety: Eliminates magic strings and typo-prone comparisons across filters, badges, and version histories.
  - Boundary isolation: Normalizing `submissionData` at the service boundary guarantees components consume clean, canonical `{ pdfUrl, zipUrl, linkUrl }` without needing dual-key checks or `as` type assertions.
- **Consequences**:
  - Status types must be exported as string enums in `types/`.
  - API response and payload translation must occur within `services/` rather than leaking into React components.
