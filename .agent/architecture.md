# Frontend Architecture

## Overview

`techeniac-lms-frontend` is the web client for the Techeniac Learning Management System. It is built as a single decoupled client repository interacting with `techeniac-lms-backend` via its versioned REST API (`/api/v1`).

## Core Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 24 LTS (see `.nvmrc` and `package.json` engines)
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router with Turbopack)
- **UI Library**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript in strict mode (`strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, `noImplicitOverride: true`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/turbopack`)
- **Module & Import Alias**: ECMAScript Modules (ESM) with import alias `@/*` pointing to project root

## Directory Organization & Responsibilities

- **`app/`**: Next.js App Router structure:
  - `(public)/`: Unauthenticated public pages (e.g. landing page, public course catalog).
  - `(auth)/`: Authenticated user application routes (e.g. student dashboard, course consumption, instructor studio, admin settings).
  - `layout.tsx`: Root HTML shell and font configuration.
  - `error.tsx`: Root client-side error boundary with retry capability.
  - `not-found.tsx`: Global 404 handler.
- **`components/`**: Four-tier component architecture:
  - `ui/`: Primitive, domain-agnostic UI building blocks (buttons, inputs, dialogs, badges).
  - `patterns/`: Reusable composite UI patterns (data tables, form containers, filter bars).
  - `layout/`: Global and route group layout scaffolding (navigation bars, sidebars, footers).
  - `app/`: Feature-specific composite views tied directly to LMS pages.
- **`hooks/`**: Custom, reusable React hooks for UI interactions and device capabilities.
- **`services/`**: API interaction services connecting to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (`/api/v1`).
- **`lib/`**: Generic pure utility functions, client library wrappers, and client-side validation schemas (`lib/validation/`).
- **`context/`**: React contexts reserved strictly for localized client-only UI state (theme, sidebar toggle).
- **`proxy.ts`**: Edge routing/proxy placeholder for early UX redirects (Next.js 16 convention replacing deprecated `middleware.ts`).

## Architectural Principles

1. **Server State vs Client State**:
   - Server state (courses, users, enrollments) is managed and cached exclusively via TanStack Query. It is never copied into or synchronized with local global state managers.
2. **Contract-Driven Typing**:
   - Types for backend resources and API payloads must be generated from the backend's OpenAPI contract rather than manually typed to prevent interface drift.
3. **Decoupled Repositories**:
   - The frontend remains fully autonomous from the backend repository, communicating only over standardized HTTP/REST APIs.
4. **Security Boundary Distinction**:
   - Frontend route protection and proxy are UX conveniences. The backend is the sole source of authorization and validation.
